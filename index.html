            <li>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            </li>
            <p>Code example:</p>
            <code>// the hello world program<br>
            console.log('Hello World');</code>
            <p></p>

                Java
            </header>
            <li>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation
                dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application
                developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need for recompilation.</li>
            <p>Code example:</p>
            <code>import java.util.Scanner;<br>
            <br>
            public class HelloWorld {<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp // Creates a reader instance which takes<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp // input from standard input - keyboard<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp System.out.print("Enter a number: ");<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp // nextInt() reads the next integer from the keyboard<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp int number = reader.nextInt();<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp // println() prints the following line to the output screen<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp System.out.println("You entered: " + number);<br>
                    &nbsp }<br>
            }</code>

                Python
            </header>
            <li>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as
                well
                as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                large-scale
                projects.</li>
            <p>Code example:</p>
            <code># This program prints Hello, world!<br>
            <br>
            print('Hello, world!')</code>

                C++
            </header>
            <li>C++, is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an
                extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly
                over
                time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities
                for
                low-level memory manipulation.</li>
            <p>Code example:</p>
            <code>// Your First C++ Program<br>
            <br>
            #include <iostream><br>
            <br>
            int main() {<br>
                &nbsp std::cout << "Hello World!";<br>
                &nbsp return 0;<br>
            }</code>

            <li>C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign) is a
                general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing,
                lexically
                scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and
                component-oriented
                programming disciplines.</li>
            <p>Code example:</p>
            <code>using System;<br>
            <br>
            namespace HelloWorld<br>
            {<br>
